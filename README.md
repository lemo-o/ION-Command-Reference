# ION 1200 Command Reference

This is the command reference for the CloudGenix / Palo Alto ION 1200s. 

I couldn't find reliable command information for the ION devices, so I pulled a dump of all the commands from the CLI of a live ION1200 device.

## Usage
Commands are located in *ION1200reference.txt*

The easiest way to use this file is to simply Ctrl+F for the command you are looking for. 

I've found that the commands are usually named something unintuitive. For example the uptime command is *dump device status.*
